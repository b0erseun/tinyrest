# tinyrest
Small footprint rest framework - for use in environments where resources are limited (raspberry pi or similar).

Should be easy to use if you are familiar with Spring Boot.

Using Jetty as a http server and servlet container and Gson for JSON marcshalling.

I've added the output of jmap -histo for both a very simple Spring boot application and a tinyrest application.

Use this at own risk   :-)
